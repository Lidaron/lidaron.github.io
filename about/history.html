<h2 id="h2_firstunisun">The First UNIS-UN</h2>
<p>
	UNIS-UN was founded in 1976. The first ever UNIS-UN conference was held in 1977
	and was attended by approximately 70-80 seniors from UNIS. It was organized in an
	effort to strengthen the bond between the United Nations International School and
	the United Nations to educate UNIS students about issues of global importance. As
	one of the student founders explained: "We were all the children of people from
	the United Nations, yet we knew so little about what it did and what issues it faced."
	While maintaining the fundamental mission and structure, our organization has grown
	with constant experience.
